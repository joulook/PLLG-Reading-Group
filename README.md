2. **Write notes** that reflect personal understanding (not copy-paste).  
3. **Build small practical projects** inspired by the papers (algorithm implementations, etc.).  
4. Create a shared resource that grows into a **study guide** for everyone.

## 🌟 Why This Matters
- Writing notes forces deeper reflection and understanding.  
- A few months later, revisiting your notes will refresh the concepts.  
- Group effort ensures diverse perspectives.  
- Eventually, we can compile notes into a polished **community study guide**.

## 🕒 Workflow
- Weekly meetings to discuss the paper and share insights will be announced in the Telegram group.
- If you don’t understand something, open an issue or discussion — others can help.
