# CS-ReadingClub 📚

A collaborative repository for studying, summarizing, and experimenting with **computer science papers**.  

---

## 🎯 Goals
1. **Read & summarize** CS papers.  
2. **Write LaTeX notes** that reflect personal understanding (not copy-paste).  
3. **Build small practical projects** inspired by the papers (algorithm implementations, etc.).  
4. Create a shared resource that grows into a **study guide** for everyone.  

---

## 📂 Structure
- `/notes` → LaTeX notes and summaries from participants.  
- `/src` → Small projects or experiments inspired by the papers.  
- `/resources` → References, book recommendations, related links.  

---

## 📚 Suggested Starting Points
Some highly influential papers and their supporting books:
- C.A.R. Hoare — *An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming* (1969).  
- Donald Knuth — *The Art of Computer Programming* (inspired by many classic results).  
- Dijkstra — *Notes on Structured Programming*.  
- Lamport — *Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System*.  

Books for background:
- Glynn Winskel — *The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages*.  
- Apt & Olderog — *Verification of Sequential and Concurrent Programs*.

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines
1. Fork the repo & create a branch.  
2. Add your **LaTeX notes** in `/notes/YourName/`.  
3. Notes should highlight **what *you* learned**.  
4. Push and open a Pull Request.  
5. Optional: add a small experiment or project in `/src`.  

---

## 🌟 Why This Matters
- Writing notes forces deeper reflection and understanding.  
- A few months later, revisiting your notes will refresh the concepts.  
- Group effort ensures diverse perspectives.  
- Eventually, we can compile notes into a polished **community study guide**.  

---

## 🕒 Workflow
- No strict meetings required.  
- If you don’t understand something, open an issue or discussion — others can help.

## 🚀 Let’s Begin!
Start with Hoare (1969) and share your notes.  
Then move on to other classics — from programming languages to distributed systems.
