Textbooks:

There are many classic textbooks on Hoare Logic and program verification. Here are a few recommendations which covers
the topics in the papers:
- [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) by Benjamin C. Pierce et al.
- [Verification of Sequential and Concurrent Programs](https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/14569/14569A.pdf) by Krzysztof R. Apt et al.
- [The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages: An Introduction](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~if721/intranet/TheFormalSemanticsofProgrammingLanguages.pdf) by Glynn Winskel

Additional papers:

The Hoare 1969 paper is based on the Robert Floyd's 1967 paper:
- [Robert W. Floyd. Assigning Meanings to Programs(1967)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/Papers/FloydMeaning.pdf)

Hoare logic has been extended to reason about concurrent programs:
- [Susan Owicki and David Gries. An Axiomatic Proof Technique for Parallel Programs(1976)](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/6393/75-251.ps?sequence=2)

Here is a survey paper the impact of the GCL and Edsger Dijkstra's work on nondeterminism:

- [Krzysztof R. Apt and E.-R. Olderog. Nondeterminism and Guarded Commands](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09004)

Here is a survey paper on the impact of Hoare logic on program verification:
- [Krzysztof R. Apt and E.-R. Olderog. Fifty Years of Hoareâ€™s Logic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03917)
